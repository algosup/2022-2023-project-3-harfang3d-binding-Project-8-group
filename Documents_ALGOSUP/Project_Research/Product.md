# Product

The purpose of the document is to present the researches done concerning the product during this project. It will give a overview of what is the product, who are the potential clients, and the competition it will face on the market.

## What?

Harfang main product is Harfang3D, they also have FABGen, a bindings generator created for Harfang3D; the project being about FABGen we will not give details on Harfang3D. Currently FABGen is supported with:

- Python,
- Lua,
- GOlang,

and we are working toward adding Rust to that list.

## Market

FABGen is targeting devellopers working in the industry wanting to use Harfang3D but not working in C++, but on Python for example. FABGen can also interest devellopers not working on Harfang3D but devellopers working on libraries, or needing the use of bindings.

## Competition

For the competition we have [SWIG](https://www.swig.org/) that is what is mainly used today. We also have [UniFFI](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs) that is being used principally to work on mobile application, and that support a different set of languages (except for Python that is available on both FABGen and UniFFI).
