# Test Cases for Python C++ to Rust Converter Library

The C++ is contained in a python file. The C++ code is converted to Rust. The Rust code is then saved to a file and can be compiled and executed.

## Language Conversion Test

### Objective

To ensure that the library correctly converts C++ code to Rust.

### Pre-conditions

- Python code file is accessible
- Python and C++ are installed

### Input

- Valid Python code file

### Expected Output

- Equivalent Rust code file

### Post-conditions

- Rust code file is created
- Rust code file can be compiled and executed

### Steps

1. Open the library in Python
2. Import the Python code file
3. Convert the C++ code to Rust
4. Save the Rust code file
5. Compile the Rust code file
6. Execute the Rust code file
7. Verify that the output is as expected

## Error Handling Test

### Objective

To ensure that the library can handle and properly report errors that occur during code conversion.

### Pre-conditions

- Python code file is accessible
- Python and C++ are installed

### Input

- Invalid Python code file

### Expected Output

- Error message describing the issue

### Post-conditions

- Error message is displayed

### Steps

1. Open the library in Python
2. Import the Python code file
3. Attempt to convert the C++ code to Rust
4. Verify that an error message is displayed
5. Verify that the error message correctly describes the issue

## Performance Test

### Objective

To ensure that the library performs well and efficiently when converting large amounts of code.

### Pre-conditions

- Python code file is accessible
- Python and C++ are installed

### Input

- Large amount of C++ code

### Expected Output

- Conversion is completed in an acceptable amount of time

### Post-conditions

- Rust code file is created
- Rust code file can be compiled and executed

### Steps

1. Open the library in Python
2. Import the Python code file
3. Measure the time taken to convert the C++ code to Rust
4. Save the Rust code file
5. Compile the Rust code file
6. Execute the Rust code file
7. Verify that the output is as expected
8. Compare the time taken to convert the code with the acceptable time limit

## Functional Test

### Objective

To ensure that the library can convert complex C++ code with multiple functions, classes and objects and the output is working and equivalent Rust code.

### Pre-conditions

- Python code file is accessible
- Python and C++ are installed

### Input

- Complex C++ code in Python file

### Expected Output

- Equivalent Rust code file

### Post-conditions

- Rust code file is created
- Rust code file can be compiled and executed
- No functions, classes or objects are missing from the Rust code file

### Steps

1. Open the library in Python
2. Import the Python code file
3. Convert the C++ code to Rust
4. Verify that all functions, classes, and objects in the C++ code are correctly translated to Rust
5. Save the Rust code file
6. Compile the Rust code file
7. Execute the Rust code file
8. Verify that the output is as expected

## Boundary Test

### Objective

To ensure that the library can handle the maximum/minimum limit of characters/lines that can be converted.

### Pre-conditions

- Python code file is accessible
- Python and C++ are installed

### Input

- Python code file with maximum/minimum limit of characters/lines

### Expected Output

- Rust code file is created

### Post-conditions

- Rust code file can be compiled and executed

### Steps

1. Open the library in Python
2. Import the Python code file
3. Convert the C++ code to Rust
4. Save the Rust code file
5. Compile the Rust code file
6. Execute the Rust code file
7. Verify that the output is as expected
8. Test the library with different values close to the maximum/minimum limit of characters/lines to ensure that it can handle edge cases.
