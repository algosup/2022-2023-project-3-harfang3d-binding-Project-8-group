# Product

## What?

Harfang main product is Harfang3D, they also have FABGen, a bindings generator created for Harfang3D; the project being about FABGen we will not give details on Harfang3D.

## Market

FABGen is targeting devellopers working in the industry wanting to use Harfang3D but not working in C++, but instead on Python for example.

## Competition

For the competition we have [SWIG](https://www.swig.org/) but it is old not well maintained. We also have [UniFFI](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs) that is being used by mozilla, and that support a different set of languages (except for Python that is available on both FABGen and UniFFI).
